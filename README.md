# openweather-api project
I wanted to learn about working with APIs to help me with a website that I want to build. I was told to use an API when building the website. So, I was referred to research on how to do that via Google. I came across this YouTube video (https://youtu.be/InoAIgBZIEA) to start!

## My take aways
1. Knowing basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS is good. 
2. API looks scary at first, but becomes friendly once you understand. 
3. Now I have my on weather website :)
